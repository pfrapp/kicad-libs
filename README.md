## Overview

### Cortex M4 TM4C123G Evaluation Board

This is my bread-and-butter evaluation board.
The footprint basically consists of 4 pin headers,
grouped in two groups of two each.
I have not yet included all pins, but only those
which I use.

### Cortex M4 TM4C123GH6PM chip

This is the actual 64 pin chip, with 16 pins on each of the 4 sides.
The spacing is 0.5 mm.
Not too hard to solder even without industrial grade equipment,
given the solder mask is layed out correctly.

Facts and figures: 80 MHz, 256 KB Flash storage, 32 KB RAM, ca. 10 Euros per piece.
